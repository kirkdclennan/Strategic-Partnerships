üß¨What Did We Learn?
, , , , , the above Ameresco (AR/LA) DRAFT Strategy Summary is a reference document that can be utilized for this afternoon's 3:30 p.m. Teams meeting. I just noticed a conflict on my calendar with a Doctor's appointment. Xavier developed this document which we have used several times. I have made some edits that need SPI Team input. We identify Geography (AR/LA); then Agency (state, regional, K-12, higher education, municipal, etc.); and Title (Director, Chancellor, President, Public Works, Etc.) in order to organize a predictable outreach campaign. Once this is completed, we can proceed with outreach. Please excuse my absence, have a productive conversation, and see you soon. - Kirk
